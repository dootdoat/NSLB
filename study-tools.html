        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Which apps and tools are worth using?</h2>
        <p>
          Here are some free and popular tools that OSU students swear by:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Notion:</strong> Great for organizing notes, syllabi, tasks, and study plans in one place.</li>
          <li><strong>Anki:</strong> Uses spaced repetition flashcards to help with memory-based subjects like biology, anatomy, and languages.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Calendar:</strong> Easily schedule classes, block out study hours, and set assignment reminders.</li>
          <li><strong>Grammarly:</strong> Helps polish your papers by catching grammar and tone issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Purdue OWL:</strong> A top resource for writing, formatting citations, and avoiding plagiarism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          OSU also gives access to Microsoft Office and Adobe tools through your student login—use them!
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What study techniques actually work?</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Active Recall:</strong> Instead of re-reading notes, quiz yourself from memory. This builds strong brain connections.</li>
          <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Study material several times over increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days) to lock in information.</li>
          <li><strong>Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Focus hard for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, and repeat. It helps you stay energized and avoid burnout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Combining techniques gives the best results. Flashcards + active recall + short sessions = success.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How do you manage your time?</h2>
        <p>
          Time management starts with breaking large assignments into small steps and setting personal deadlines. Use Google Calendar or a planner to block study time each week. Reserve enough time for each class—aim for 2 hours of study per week for every credit hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try this routine:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Sunday:</strong> Set weekly goals, organize your tasks, and prep materials</li>
          <li><strong>Monday–Friday:</strong> Stick to a consistent study schedule (e.g., 10am–12pm every day)</li>
          <li><strong>Saturday:</strong> Review the week and catch up</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How do you make the most of your space?</h2>
        <p>
          Even in a dorm or shared apartment, you can create a productive environment:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Use noise-canceling headphones or ambient music (try Lo-Fi playlists)</li>
          <li>Keep your desk tidy and limit distractions (put your phone out of reach)</li>
          <li>Study in places like Thompson Library, the 18th Avenue Library, or quiet lounges on campus</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Every student works differently, so test different methods and track what actually helps you learn better.
