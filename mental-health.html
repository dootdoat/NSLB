        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What services are available through OSU?</h2>
        <p>
          OSU offers multiple mental health and wellness options that are free or low-cost for students. The most commonly used services include:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">

        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What should you expect in therapy or support groups?</h2>
        <p>
          Therapy at OSU starts with an initial phone screening to match you with the right resource. From there, you may be scheduled for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Short-term individual counseling</li>
          <li>Topic-based support groups (anxiety, identity, academics)</li>
          <li>Workshops on stress management, test anxiety, or mindfulness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Support groups are peer-based and facilitated by professionals. They’re a safe space to connect with students facing similar challenges.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How to manage stress proactively</h2>
        <p>
          Stress isn’t always bad—but unmanaged stress can affect your sleep, focus, and overall well-being. Here are some tips to stay ahead of it:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Practice time management: Plan your week in advance and break large tasks into smaller pieces.</li>
          <li>Get physical: Use the RPAC, go for walks, or try free fitness classes.</li>
          <li>Use OSU’s free Headspace subscription for guided meditation and mindfulness.</li>
          <li>Stay connected: Talk to a friend, join a club, or go to a campus event to avoid isolation.</li>
          <li>Sleep matters: Try for 7–8 hours per night and avoid all-nighters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re feeling overwhelmed, talk to someone sooner rather than later. Help is always available—and it works.
