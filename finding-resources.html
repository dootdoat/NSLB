        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>How to navigate the OSU website to find academic, mental health, and housing resources</li>
          <li>Where to go for tutoring, writing help, and math support</li>
          <li>How to connect with your college’s academic advising team</li>
          <li>How to ask the right questions when visiting an office</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We simplify the process so you can focus on getting the support you deserve.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Where do you begin your search?</h2>
        <p>
          Start with OSU’s main website (osu.edu) and click on “Current Students.” From there, you’ll find links to offices such as Academic Advising, the Student Wellness Center, the Younkin Success Center, and Buckeye Link. You can also use the search bar to directly look up specific help like “tutoring,” “mental health services,” or “academic coaching.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Each academic college (e.g., College of Engineering, Arts and Sciences, Fisher College of Business) also maintains its own website with tailored resources, so check there too.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What resources are available?</h2>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How should you approach staff at these offices?</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re visiting in person or reaching out by email, be clear and polite. You might say:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4 italic text-gray-700">
          Hi, I’m a second-year student in the College of Arts and Sciences. I’m having trouble managing my study schedule this semester—could someone here help me find strategies or resources that could make it easier?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Staff members are there to help and will appreciate your honesty. If you’re unsure who to ask, they can often direct you to the right office or person.
