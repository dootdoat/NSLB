          Being the first in your family to attend college is a huge accomplishment—and a unique challenge. This kit includes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Strategies for navigating unfamiliar systems like financial aid, advising, and course registration</li>
          <li>Stories from other OSU first-gen students who found success</li>
          <li>How to find first-gen peer mentors and support groups</li>
          <li>A checklist for the first year to help stay on track</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You belong here. NSLB is here to make sure you thrive.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What makes the first-gen experience unique?</h2>
        <p>
          As a first-gen student, you might be the first in your family to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Fill out FAFSA</li>
          <li>Move into a dorm</li>
          <li>Navigate academic advising or career services</li>
          <li>Balance school, work, and family obligations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That’s a big deal—and it means you’ve already shown incredible resilience. But it can also lead to feeling out of place or unsure where to go for help. You are not alone in that. Thousands of other OSU students are walking a similar path.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How do you navigate unfamiliar systems?</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t need to know everything—just where to ask questions. Start with these steps:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Financial Aid:</strong> Visit Buckeye Link or speak with a financial coach at the Student Wellness Center for help with scholarships, FAFSA, or budgeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Advising:</strong> Schedule an academic advising meeting each semester to review your degree plan and check progress toward graduation.</li>
          <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Use your advisor and BuckeyeLink to learn how to register for classes and meet prerequisites on time.</li>
          <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Look out for events hosted by the First-Gen Empowerment Series, FOCUS programs, or the Bell National Resource Center.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Staff understand that first-gen students may be learning all of this for the first time—don’t hesitate to speak up and ask for clarity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How do you build confidence and community?</h2>
        <p>
          The best way to thrive is by building your network. Try:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Joining a first-gen student organization or support group (search on the Student Involvement website or check with the Multicultural Center)</li>
          <li>Attending Welcome Week and first-gen mixers at the start of the semester</li>
          <li>Connecting with a peer mentor through your academic college or residence hall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Also, take pride in your story. Your background gives you perspective, strength, and grit—qualities that are incredibly valuable in college and beyond.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">First-Year Checklist for First-Gen Students</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>Meet your academic advisor within the first month of the semester</li>
          <li>Join at least one student organization</li>
          <li>Attend a career exploration or financial wellness workshop</li>
          <li>Build a weekly study schedule</li>

          <li>Take care of your health—mental, physical, and emotional</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You’re not just surviving—you’re leading. And NSLB is here to make sure you don’t do it alone.
